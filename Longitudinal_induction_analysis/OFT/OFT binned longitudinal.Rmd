Load data

#setwd("~/Documents/TDP control files/Longitudinal induction analysis/OFT/")
# Loading
library(pacman)

We will look at two parameters:
- how much time mouse spent moving (absolute and relative to total time) (measure of exploration)
- how much time was spent on center compared to periphery (measure of anxiety, if anxious = more time spent in periphery)

Time spent moving:
```{r}
# divide by time not spent moving
df<-  df %>% mutate(relative_time_moving=(df$`Movement cumulative s`/(df$`Time not moving cumulative s`+df$`Movement cumulative s`))*100)
```

Periphery preference:

```{r}
df<-  df %>% mutate(periphery_preference=(`In zone periphery cumulative s`/(`In zone Center cumulative s`+`In zone periphery cumulative s`)*100))
```



Data set where participants not completing all data collection time points are sorted out

```{r}
# Determine the weeks each participant should have
required_weeks <- df %>% 
  distinct(Week) %>% 
  pull()

# Count the number of weeks each participant has data for
participant_week_counts <- df %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarize(week_count = n_distinct(Week))

# Identify participants with data for all required weeks
complete_participants <- participant_week_counts %>%
  filter(week_count == length(required_weeks)) %>%
  pull(ID)

# Filter the dataset to include only complete participants
df_complete <- df %>%
  filter(ID %in% complete_participants)

# View the new dataset
head(df_complete)
```
